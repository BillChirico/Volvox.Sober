## Development Workflow

1. Create feature branch from `main`
2. Follow TDD approach (write tests first)
3. Implement feature with TypeScript strict mode
4. Run quality checks: `pnpm test && pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint`
5. Commit with conventional commits (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)
6. Create pull request for review
